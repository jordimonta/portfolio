## PROJECTS

* ### Deep Learning Image retrieval for Fashion Product database

The aim of the project is the creation of a tool that allows the full implementation and evaluation of an image retrieval web application using the Fashion Product dataset as the database. Several existing pre-trained models are evaluated and also custom models are created from applying Transfer Learning from them.

The main idea is that a user can obtain the topK ranking products more similar to an image using one of the different models available.
